# Websocket Drawing
A **very** dumbed down version of Reddit's /r/place. This allows users to collaboratively create pixel art using websockets.

## Motivation
Websockets are super cool, so I wanted to learn how to use them! I created this application to help me learn them.

## Code Style
I use standard JS.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* React
* Socket.io
* CSS

## Features
Super-fast communication on changed pixels.

## Backend
* [backend](https://github.com/aspittel/websocket-drawing-backend)
